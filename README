Compilation:
	The Makefile for this project generates three executables:
		proc_fan
		testsim
		testsim2
	
	The default recipe 'make' will compile all three. If compilation of the
	test executables is not desired, use 'make proc_fan' instead.

Running the program:
	proc_fan -n PRLIMIT

	PRLIMIT must be an integer >= 1 for proc_fan to read any input from stdin
		setting PRLIMIT < 1 will result in proc_fan exiting immediately.

Version Control:
	This project's version control has been managed under git. For a log of
	modifications, use 'git log', and its various options.

Outstanding Problems:
	None, to my knowledge.

Encountered Difficulties:
	This project was really rather straight-forward. The only issue that I
	encountered was in tokenizing the line read from stdin, since I'm used to
	many higher-level languages having some kind of .split() function in
	strings. Additionally, I initially misread the definition of execvp()
	and was working under the impression that char** argv was required to
	have a tail element of "\0", when in reality it must have a tail element
	of nullptr. This led to some segfaulting and unexpected behaviour, but
	has been fixed and seems to run without any issues.

Bugtesting efforts:
	Manual input from terminal
	File read into stdin
	Multiple test programs (testsim, testsim2) with varied behaviour

	Everything appears to work without issue.
